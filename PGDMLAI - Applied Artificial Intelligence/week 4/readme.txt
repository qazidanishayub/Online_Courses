Assignment Overview
In this assignment, we will begin considering the second category of supervised learning problems from our machine learning lectures -- classification problems. Specifically, we will use Scikit-Learn to implement and evaluate classification models on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. This is to serve as a reminder and expansion of some earlier work. Later, you will explore how to apply these machine learning ideas to graphs.

This assignment is designed to build your familiarity and comfort coding in Python while also helping you review key topics from each module. As you progress through the assignment, answers will get increasingly complex. It is important that you adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment. Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and give you a chance to fix your errors before submitting. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client.

Vocareum Tips

Do not add arguments or options to functions unless you are specifically asked to. This will cause an error in Vocareum.
Do not use a library unless you are expicitly asked to in the question.
You can download the Grading Report after submitting the assignment. This will include feedback and hints on incorrect questions.
