Assignment Overview
This assignment provides an opportunity to get used to artificial neural networks for supervised machine learning. We'll do this first by looking at the perceptron algorithm as an early example of a neural network. By building a simple program implementing the perceptron, you'll get a sense of the mathematical ideas underlying the training of neural networks. From there, you'll experiment with Keras as an example of a framework for building neural networks and solve a simple classification problem as well as a regression problem.

You will also solve a few Constraint Satisfaction Problems by backtracking (including the famous  NN -Queens problem).

The goals of the present assignment are to:

Get used to the core terminology used with neural networks: layers, units, activation functions, etc.
Implement the simplest neural network algorithm (the perceptron) to build a conceptual foundation on which neural networks are built.
Solve som simple problems using a neural networks framework.
Develop simple recursive functions for backtracking.
This assignment is designed to build your familiarity and comfort coding in Python while also helping you review key topics from each module. As you progress through the assignment, answers will get increasingly complex. It is important that you adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment. Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and give you a chance to fix your errors before submitting. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client.

Vocareum Tips

Do not add arguments or options to functions unless you are specifically asked to. This will cause an error in Vocareum.
Do not use a library unless you are expicitly asked to in the question.
You can download the Grading Report after submitting the assignment. This will include feedback and hints on incorrect questions.
