Assignment Overview
In this assignment, we will look at some types of search algorithms. In the first part of the assignment, we will focus on a very popular uniform seach algorithm, the A-star (A) algorithm. After reiterating the foundations and the theory behind this algorithm, we will solve a simple problem using the Python library pathfinding. Next, you will be asked to solve a problem using the A algorithm by hand. We will work on the A* algorithm using the library networkx.

The second part of the assignment focuses on another type of algorithm, the Greedy Search algorithm. After re-iterating the basics of this algorithm, you will be asked to solve a simple problem from scratch.

This assignment is designed to build your familiarity and comfort coding in Python while also helping you review key topics from each module. As you progress through the assignment, answers will get increasingly complex. It is important that you adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment. Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and give you a chance to fix your errors before submitting. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client.
