Assignment Overview
In this assignment, you will become more familiar with another type of informed search algorithm: the Dijkstra algorithm. In the first part of the assignment, you will implement your own version of the algorithm and then you will compare the performance with the networkx implementation of it. The second part of the assignment is dedicatedto adversial search algorithms. Adversarial search is an algorithm where there is an "enemy" or "opponent" changing the state of the problem every step in a direction you do not want. After learning the basic components of a game, we will test your knowledge with the implementation of the game tic-tac-toe.

This assignment is designed to build your familiarity and comfort coding in Python while also helping you review key topics from the module. As you progress through the assignment, answers will get increasingly complex. It is important that you adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment. Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and give you a chance to fix your errors before submitting. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client.

Vocareum Tips

Do not add arguments or options to functions unless you are specifically asked to. This will cause an error in Vocareum.
Do not use a library unless you are expicitly asked to in the question.
You can download the Grading Report after submitting the assignment. This will include feedback and hints on incorrect questions.
