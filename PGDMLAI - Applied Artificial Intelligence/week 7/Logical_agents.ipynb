    "\n",
    "This assignment is designed to reinforce your knowledge about Logical Agents. In the first part of the assignment, you will explore and contribute to an implementation of the Wumpus world game. The Wumpus World’s agent is an example of a knowledge-based agent that represents knowledge representation, reasoning, and planning. \n",
    "In the second part of the assignment, you will work on propositional logic. In particular, we will\n",
    "implement functions for printing truth tables for formulas with two variables. We will conclude this second part of the assignment by implementing a function to print to truth table for formulas with more than two variables.\n",
    "The last part of the assignment focuses on forward chaining.\n",
    "Forward chaining is used to track  how things change over time and to draw conclusions from a priori clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is designed to build your familiarity and comfort coding in Python while also helping you review key topics from the module. As you progress through the assignment, answers will get increasingly complex. It is important that you adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. **Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment.** Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and give you a chance to fix your errors before submitting. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client. \n",

    "\n",
    "Often, analysts are interested in how things change over time. In a typical cross-sectional sample, even if you measure some variable today and then again a year from now, you will probably be sampling different people each time. To get a better handle on how things change for the same people over time, you need to be able to track them and follow up with them a year from now, and in future waves. This is **longitudinal data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Longitudinal data is often used in economic and financial studies because it has several advantages over repeated cross-sectional data. For example, because longitudinal data measures how long events last for, it can be used to see if the same group of individuals remain unemployed during a recession, or whether different individuals are moving in and out of unemployment. This can help determine the factors that most affect unemployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's `scikit-learn` module has a `TimeSeriesSplit` function that can help run Forward Chaining. However, the function makes an assumption that the entire DataFrame is to be treated as one entity, whereas, it is possible that the entire DataFrame is actually composed of groups of data (row-wise) each of which group should be treated to Forward Chaining separately. The [Financial Distress Prediction Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/shebrahimi/financial-distress) that we will be using here is exactly this type of a data set.\n",
