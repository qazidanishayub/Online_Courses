Assignment Overview
This assignment is designed to reinforce your knowledge about Logical Agents. In the first part of the assignment, you will explore and contribute to an implementation of the Wumpus world game. The Wumpus Worldâ€™s agent is an example of a knowledge-based agent that represents knowledge representation, reasoning, and planning. In the second part of the assignment, you will work on propositional logic. In particular, we will implement functions for printing truth tables for formulas with two variables. We will conclude this second part of the assignment by implementing a function to print to truth table for formulas with more than two variables. The last part of the assignment focuses on forward chaining. Forward chaining is used to track how things change over time and to draw conclusions from a priori clauses.

This assignment is designed to build your familiarity and comfort coding in Python while also helping you review key topics from the module. As you progress through the assignment, answers will get increasingly complex. It is important that you adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment. Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and give you a chance to fix your errors before submitting. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client.

Vocareum Tips

Do not add arguments or options to functions unless you are specifically asked to. This will cause an error in Vocareum.
Do not use a library unless you are explicitly asked to in the question.
You can download the Grading Report after submitting the assignment. This will include feedback and hints on incorrect questions.
Learning Objectives
Implement a basic version of the Wumpus World game
