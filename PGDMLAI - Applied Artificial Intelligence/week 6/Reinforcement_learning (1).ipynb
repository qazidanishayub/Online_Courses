    "\n",
    "The focus of this assignment is **Reinforcement Learning**, i.e., the branch of machine learning concerned with choosing actions in an environment where labeled input/output pairs may not be available and sub-optimal actions may not be explicitly corrected. The principal idea is to balance the exploration of uncharted territory with exploitation of current knowledge to maximize some kind of a cumulative reward. In this assignment, we aim to encapsulate the ideas from the lectures in code. In the first part, we'll use some basic pre-made environments from OpenAI's `gym` package to explore the effect of different policies on agents. In the second part, we'll experiment with a *multi-armed bandit*.\n",

    "This assignment is designed to build your familiarity and comfort coding in Python while also helping you review key topics from each module. As you progress through the assignment, answers will get increasingly complex. It is important that you adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. **Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment.** Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and give you a chance to fix your errors before submitting. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client. \n",

    "## Multi-Armed Bandit Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "When you go to restaurant many times, how do you balance your desire to stick to your \"favorite dish\" with the desire to find out more about other items in the menu? That is an example of what we call a [_multi-armed bandit problem_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a _multi-armed bandit problem_ the decision-maker has to repeatedly choose among $n$ options (\"arms\") where each arm yields a random _reward_ that is drawn from a fixed but unknown probability distribution associated with that arm. In the restaurant example, each item in the menu is an arm, and the rewards are not all that random (dishes can vary, as well as your appreciation for them, but typically not much). \n",
    "\n",
    "The crucial feature of multi-armed bandit problems is the _trade-off between exploration and exploitation_: to learn what arms are better than others, we need to try a variety of them; but we need to balance that need for learning with the desire to reap the rewards of what we learned so far by using more often the arms we believe are more effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bandit algorithms can be especially useful because they are _online algorithms_, and can help the solution you choose stay \"good\" even if \"the world changes\", that is, the quality/rewards distribution of the arms change over time. In other words, bandit algorithms can perform well even when the reward distributions are _nonstationary_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-armed bandit applications abound. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimal ad choice for an advertising campaign\n",
    "- Optimal portfolio selection in finance\n",

When we pick an arm to pull, we call the corresponding function, which gives us a random reward. We do not know what those functions are, but we do know that, *for each arm, there exists a fixed probability distribution such that the rewards of that arm are identically-independent distributed (iid) draws from that distribution*.\n",

Our goal is to pick a policy for choosing ads which leads to the highest probability of a click (click-through rate, or CTR), as soon as possible.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is desirable to write our functions/classes in a way that makes their reuse possible in a wide variety of situations. That happens when the components of our codebase (functions, data structures, etc.) are _loosely coupled_. For example, the simulation code doesn't need to know details of which policy is being used; it just needs to know how to ask a given transition function for the next state. Crucially, some state variables have to exist (like `arm_pulls`, and `arm_rewards`) across all policies/transitions for that work. Again, carefully modeling state is important for both mathematical and software engineering reasons! \n",
