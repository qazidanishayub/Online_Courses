Project Overview
This assignment provides an overview of Natural Language Processing (NLP) as an approach to classification problems in supervised learning involving textual data (in particular using Naive Bayes classifiers). In spite of the "naive" assumptions involved, Naive Bayes works very well in practice particularly for text analysis in, for instance, spam filtering or document classification. As such, for this assignment, you will build a very simple model of spam filtering to get a sense of how naive Bayes classification really works. Then, you will explore the use of tools within Scikit-Learn for NLP.

The primary goals of the current assignment are:

to become familiar with the terminology and tools available for NLP;
to practice the application of Bayes' theorem for probabilistic reasoning; and
to develop a (highly simplified) model of text analysis for spam classification using the naive Bayes classification framework.
This assignment is designed to build your familiarity and comfort coding in Python while also helping you review key topics from the module. As you progress through the assignment, answers will get increasingly complex. It is important that you adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment. Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and give you a chance to fix your errors before submitting. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client.

Vocareum Tips

Do not add arguments or options to functions unless you are specifically asked to. This will cause an error in Vocareum.
Do not use a library unless you are expicitly asked to in the question.
You can download the Grading Report after submitting the assignment. This will include feedback and hints on incorrect questions.
