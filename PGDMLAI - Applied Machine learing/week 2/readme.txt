Assignment Overview
This assignment will test your ability to code your own version of ridge-regularized regression in Python. Ridge Regression offers a way to mitigate some of the weaknesses of Least Squares Linear Regression to build more robust models. This assignment draws upon and presupposes the knowledge found in the lectures for Module 13.

The assignment also builds upon the work performed in the module 13 assignment "Linear Regression - Least Squares". The data used will be the same. Though the last assignment tested your ability to read data into Pandas from a .csv. Those fundamental processes will not be directly tested here.

This assignment is designed to build your familiarity and comfort coding in Python while also helping you review key topics from each module. As you progress through the assignment, answers will get increasingly complex. It is important that you adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment. Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and give you a chance to fix your errors before submitting. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client.

Vocareum Tips

Do not add arguments or options to functions unless you are specifically asked to. This will cause an error in Vocareum.
Do not use a library unless you are expicitly asked to in the question.
You can download the Grading Report after submitting the assignment. This will include feedback and hints on incorrect questions.
