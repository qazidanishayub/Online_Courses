Assignment Overview
This assignment extends the work done on Random Forests in the assignment for module 18.

Initially, the assignment is theory heavy, both a simple classifier and an adaptive boosting model will be built from scratch. This will primarily involve creating Python implementations of the algorithms found in lectures both from this and last week week. As usual, pre-built versions in sklearn of these algorithms will be demonstrated at the end of the lesson.
Building the algorithms from scratch help to ensure the depth of theoretical knowledge before allowing Python and its packages to handle the heavy lifting.

This assignment is designed to build your familiarity and comfort in coding in Python. It will also help you review the key topics from each module. As you progress through the assignment, answers to the questions will get increasingly complex. You must adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment. Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and giving you a chance to fix your errors before submitting. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client.

Vocareum Tips

Do not add arguments or options to functions unless asked specifically. This will cause an error in Vocareum.
Do not use a library unless you are explicitly asked in the question.
You can download the Grading Report after submitting the assignment. It will include the feedback and hints on incorrect questions.
