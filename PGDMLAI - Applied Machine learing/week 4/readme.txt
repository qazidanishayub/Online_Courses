Assignment Overview
K-Nearest Neighnours (KNN) is a reasonably simple algorithm that is easy to grasp and can be very effective. This assignment will test your abilities in three different parts. In the first part, you will familiarize yourself with the problem and data. In the second part, you will code a KNN Classifier from scratch, evaluate performance, and compare to Scikit-Learn's implementation. Finally, in the last part you will interpret results and explain findings.

In the first part, we will revisit Bayes' formula and evaluate your ability to calculate simple Bayesian posterior probabilities. In the second part, we will ask you to build functions that calculate the parameters of Bayesian posteriors for Bayesian Linear Regression.

This assignment is designed to build your familiarity and comfort coding in Python while also helping you review key topics from each module. As you progress through the assignment, answers will get increasingly complex. It is important that you adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment. Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and give you a chance to fix your errors before submitting it. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client.

Vocareum Tips

Do not add arguments or options to functions unless asked specifically. This will cause an error in Vocareum.
Do not use a library unless asked explicitly in the question.
You can download the Grading Report after submitting the assignment. It will include the feedback and hints on the incorrect questions.
