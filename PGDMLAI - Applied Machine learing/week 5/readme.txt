Assignment Overview
Logistic regression offers a way to create a fairly interpretable parametric model for binary classification. This assignment will work through the definition of a logistic regression function in Python. After summarizing the equations and a brief EDA of the 'Titanic' data that we will be using, you will be asked to define many functions that will create a logistic regression.
A demonstration of sklearn's implementation of Logistic Regression will close the assignment.

You will be asked to code functions to do the following:

Implement the Logistic Regression Algorithm
Calculate the value of the sigmoid function
Calculate the gradient of the log-likelihood with respect to  ww 
Sum the gradients of the log-likelihood with respect to  ww 
Execute logistic regression, stopping after a particular iteration
Determine convergence of the logistic regression algorithm
This assignment is designed to build your familiarity and comfort in coding in Python. It will also help you review the key topics from each module. As you progress through the assignment, answers to the questions will get increasingly complex. You must adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment. Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and giving you a chance to fix your errors before submitting. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client.

Vocareum Tips

Do not add arguments or options to functions unless asked specifically. This will cause an error in Vocareum.
Do not use a library unless you are explicitly asked in the question.
You can download the Grading Report after submitting the assignment. It will include the feedback and hints on incorrect questions.
