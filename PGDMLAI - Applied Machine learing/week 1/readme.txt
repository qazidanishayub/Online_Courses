Assignment Overview
This assignment will test your ability to code your own version of least squares regression in Python. After a brief review of some of the content from the lecture you will be asked to create a number of functions that will eventually be able to read in raw data to Pandas and perform a least squares regression on a subset of that data.

This will include:

Calculating least squares weights
Reading data on dist to return Pandas DataFrame
Select data by column
Implement column cut-offs
This assignment is designed to build your familiarity and comfort coding in Python while also helping you review key topics from each module. As you progress through the assignment, answers will get increasingly complex. It is important that you adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment. Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and give you a chance to fix your errors before submitting. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client.

Vocareum Tips

Do not add arguments or options to functions unless you are specifically asked to. This will cause an error in Vocareum.
Do not use a library unless you are expicitly asked to in the question.
You can download the Grading Report after submitting the assignment. This will include feedback and hints on incorrect questions.
