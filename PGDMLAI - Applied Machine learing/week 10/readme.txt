Assignment Overview
In this assignment, we will work on principal component analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated variables that successively maximize variance.

In the second part of the assignment we will explain some basic concepts and familiarize with the theory about Markov chains. We will introduce you to one of the Python libraries, quantecon that come with the capability of simulating Markov chains processes. This second part of the assignment is intended to be more theory heavy, most of the coding about Markov chain will be asked for you to do in the next assignment.

This assignment is designed to build your familiarity and comfort in coding in Python. It will also help you review the key topics from each module. As you progress through the assignment, answers to the questions will get increasingly complex. You must adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment. Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and giving you a chance to fix your errors before submitting it. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client.

Vocareum Tips

Do not add arguments or options to functions unless asked specifically. This will cause an error in Vocareum.
Do not use a library unless you are explicitly asked in the question.
You can download the Grading Report after submitting the assignment. It will include the feedback and hints on incorrect questions.
