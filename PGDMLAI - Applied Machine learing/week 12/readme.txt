Assignment Overview
In this assignment, we will work on association analysis.

As we have seen, there are many complex ways to analyze data (clustering, regression, Neural Networks, Random Forests, SVM, etc.). The challenge with many of these approaches is that they can be difficult to tune, challenging to interpret and require quite a bit of data prep and feature engineering to get good results. In other words, they can be very powerful but require a lot of knowledge to implement properly.

Association analysis is relatively light on math concepts and easy to explain to non-technical people. In addition, it is an unsupervised learning tool that looks for hidden patterns, so there is limited need for data prep and feature engineering. It is a good start for certain cases of data exploration and can point the way for a deeper dive into the data using other approaches.

For this assignment we will use the Python implementation of association analysis found in the MLxtend library. This implementation should be very familiar to anyone who has exposure to scikit-learn and pandas.

NOTE: Technically, market basket analysis is just one application of association analysis. In this assignment though, we will use association analysis and market basket analysis terms interchangeably.

This assignment is designed to build your familiarity and comfort in coding in Python. It will also help you review the key topics from each module. As you progress through the assignment, answers to the questions will get increasingly complex. You must adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment. Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and giving you a chance to fix your errors before submitting it. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client.

Vocareum Tips

Do not add arguments or options to functions unless asked specifically. This will cause an error in Vocareum.
Do not use a library unless you are explicitly asked in the question.
You can download the Grading Report after submitting the assignment. It will include the feedback and hints on incorrect questions.
