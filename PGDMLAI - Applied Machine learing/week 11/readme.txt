Assignment Overview
In this assignment, we will work on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). HMMs can be effective in solving problems in reinforcement learning and temporal pattern recognition. In this assignment, we will:

Use clustering
Decide on the type of HMM problem
Initialize and tune HMM parameters
The implementation of HMM from scratch may involve complex code that might be difficult to comprehend and is not the most robust and efficient.

In this assignment, we:

Prioritize the demonstration of the algorithm's steps while maintaining reproducibility
Define and implement certain tasks and non-essential features of the algorithm (example: 'Signature' and 'Parameter' classes) without explanation.
We are not expecting students to understand the entirety of the codebase. Rather, we will test students on their high-level understanding of HMM and some critical functions.

We have designed this assignment to build your familiarity and comfort in coding in Python. It will also help you review the key topics from each module. As you progress through the assignment, answers to the questions will get increasingly complex. You must adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment. Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and giving you a chance to fix your errors before submitting it. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client.

Vocareum Tips

Do not add arguments or options to functions unless asked specifically. This will cause an error in Vocareum.
Do not use a library unless you are explicitly asked in the question.
You can download the Grading Report after submitting the assignment. It will include the feedback and hints on incorrect questions.
